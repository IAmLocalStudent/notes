Feature	Explicit Grid		Implicit Grid


Size control			Fully customizable using grid-template-rows and 	grid-template-columns .	Controlled by grid-auto-rows and grid-auto-columns , or defaults to auto .
Default Behavior		Does not change unless explicitly defined.		Automatically adapts to items placed outside the explicit grid.
Complexity			Requires more planning for layout structure.		Easier to implement for unstructured or variable content.
Flexibility			Rigid structure with defined rows and columns.		Flexible and adapts to dynamically placed content.
Performance			Potentially more performant as the layout is predefined.	May require additional browser computations for implicit grid generation.
Use case			Useful when the grid structure is predictable and defined upfront.	Useful for dynamic layouts where content is unknown or changes frequently.
